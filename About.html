        <p class="about"> Hello there fayo here. Born and raised in Bale Robe. Currently I am Software Engineering student at ASTU(Adama Science and Technology University) and ALX (African Leadership University). As a dedicated and ambitious student, I am actively expanding my knowledge and skills in the field of software engineering and technology. In my journey to become a skilled software engineer, I have actively sought opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skills. One of the notable programs I participated in was the Addis Coder program. During my academic journey, I have acquired a strong foundation in software development methodologies, programming languages, and problem-solving techniques. I am particularly interested in exploring areas such as Python, web development, and other emerging technologies that shape the future of software engineering.
